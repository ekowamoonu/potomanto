        <h3 class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>Okay, so what exactly is Potomanto?</b></h3>
        <blockquote class="wow animated fadeInUp">
        Potomanto is a file sharing platform and the online archive of the portfolios of students from the various universities in Ghana. We are passionate about bringing students and alumnis all over the country together into one single place where they can
        easily see the portfolio of their colleagues, contact each other and share project ideas and files. So not only is this system
        meant for just students, but anyone who has attended an institution and graduated as well. Yes that also includes all working professionals
        who have graduated from an institution.
        </blockquote>

        <h3 class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>Our Mission</b></h3>
        <blockquote class="wow animated fadeInUp">
        To make files and projects sharing between students and alumnis refreshingly easy.
        To build the largest knowledge base of files, videos, and other academic documents.

        <h3 class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>Why the name 'Potomanto'?</b></h3>
        <blockquote class="wow animated fadeInUp">
         'Potomanto' is a local Ghanaian word which means 'briefcase' or 'document bag'. We chose this name because it is easy to remember,
         it is catchy, weird and funny in a totally different way. Its also very African.
        </blockquote>


        <h3 class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>So why should I use Potomanto?</b></h3>
        <blockquote class="wow animated fadeInUp">
        Because Potomanto is amazingly simple to use, no crowdiness and downloads are easy. You don't need any third party softwares.
        Also, files on potomanto consists of knownledge filled files not only from you school but other insitutions as well.
        The world has became a global village with so many platforms trying to connect people from all over the world to each other.
        From the number of students who graduate from the institutions every year especially in Ghana, we believe aiming at connecting students and alumnis
        at the most atomic level will in some years pay off extremely. Students thus, form an integral part of the future building 
        blocks for our nation. Our aim is not to build some sort of feature-rich social media where 
        students and alumnis can chat and comment. Our aim is to build the system, which can help you find the right person, possible team member, business partner,
        employee, project ideas, lecture notes, tutorial videos and other academic documents when you need it the most in the easiest and most efficient, possible way.

        <h3 class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>Can you tell me more about projects and files on potomanto?</b></h3>
        <blockquote class="wow animated fadeInUp">
         Of course! You could be working on a new project/file and may need some help with it. With this, you can simply login to your dashboard,
         enter some details of your project/files, upload a documentation and simply post it. As long as you provide a good description 
         for what you want, your project will be seen by an interested fellow together with a link to your potomanto details.The person
         can contact you and you just take over from there. You can also make your project documents or codes available for download
         by others or you can make it closed. It gets better, potomanto allows you the option of setting a time limit for which your
         project or file  should remain online. <br/><br/>
   
         This option is extremely useful when you don't want your files to remain online for too long but long enough for the appropriate
         people to access it. Just in case the file you want to share is not in the required format, simply put it into a zip folder and
         upload it again.

         On the other hand, you can also search and find projects you are looking for and may be interested in working on. Incase the 
         project is a closed one, a pop up will appear on your screen giving you the details of the owner of the project whom you can
         contact.

         Potomanto seeks to remove the too much restrictions on simple file sharing. So go on and start uploading the lecture notes,
         the assignments, the code files, the projects, your other documents and also enjoy how much you can make your files
         self destructive by setting your deadlines.

        <h3 class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>Extra tips to get the best out of potomanto</b></h3>
        <blockquote class="wow animated fadeInUp">
         <ul>
          <li>Upload an old picture of you in your early days in college as your Poto-face. This gives your portfolio a super cool standard.</li>
          <li>Provide enough description about your project.</li>
          <li>The documentation of the project you upload can be just one file. It can also contain images and references for your 
            research.</li>
          <li>Potomanto is optimized to work well on a large range of different screen sizes but to get the very best experience
          we would advice that you use Microsft Edge Internet Browser on Windows 10, because its rendering aging suits best the design style of Potomanto.
          You can easily use other browsers as well to get a wonderful experience but then, like we said, there is always a better option.
